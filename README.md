## Question
```
1. The shortest path from source node to all possible nodes with PRIMS, KRISKALS, DIJKSTRA'S algorithms using C/C++/Python/Java. Give a justification for the choice of the programming language.

2. Give a note of comparison regarding the performance of the algorithms. If you feel that any of the algorithms fail to find any of the required paths, give justification for the same.
```
```
I used the C programming language to find the shortest path using PRIMS, KRUSKALS and DIJKSTRAS algorithm as i have experience in doing a few algorithms in C and also have been using C language for some time for all coding.
```

```
For this specific graph, my code for DIJKSTRAS and KRUSKALS works. The code for PRIMS does not give the complete output.
